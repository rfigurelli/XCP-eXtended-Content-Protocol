# XCP â€“ eXtended Content Protocol  
This repository introduces the original white paper proposing a **universal, semantic-first, transport-agnostic communication protocol** designed for the next generation of interconnected devices, services, and autonomous systems.

Unlike traditional communication protocols that separate transport and content semantics, **XCP** unifies them into a single extensible architecture.  
It evolves naturally from the **Model Content Protocol (MCP)**, extending its modeling principles to fully integrate **transport**, **session management**, and **dynamic semantic negotiation**.

XCP aims to create a world where any device, agent, or service can communicate **intelligently, meaningfully, and autonomously** across heterogeneous ecosystems.
